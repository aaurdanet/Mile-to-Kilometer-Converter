Mile to Kilometer Converter

This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Tkinter to convert distances from miles to kilometers. Users input a distance in miles, and upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the equivalent distance in kilometers is displayed.
Usage

  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
  Run the script using the command: python <filename>.py (replace <filename> with the name of your Python script).

Dependencies

  Python 3.x
  Tkinter (typically included with Python installations)

Functionality

  Upon running the script, a window titled "Mile to Km Converter" appears.
  Users input the distance in miles into the provided entry box.
  After clicking the "Calculate" button, the script converts the inputted distance from miles to kilometers.
  The result is displayed in the adjacent label.

How to Use

  Enter the distance in miles into the provided input field.
  Click the "Calculate" button.
  The equivalent distance in kilometers will be displayed.

Code Structure

  The script imports the tkinter module to create the GUI.
  It creates a Tkinter window titled "Mile to Km Converter".
  The user interface includes:
      An entry box for entering the distance in miles.
      Labels to display "Miles", "Km", and "equals to".
      A "Calculate" button to trigger the conversion.
  The calc() function performs the conversion when the "Calculate" button is clicked.
  The result is updated in real-time using the result_label widget.

Customization

  Customize the GUI elements such as fonts, colors, and layout according to your preferences.
  Add error handling to handle invalid inputs or edge cases more gracefully.
  Incorporate additional features, such as bidirectional unit conversion (miles to km and km to miles).

Notes

  Ensure the script is saved with the .py extension and run using a Python interpreter.

Example

Suppose the user inputs 5 miles and clicks "Calculate":

  The script calculates 5 * 1.60934 = 8.0467 kilometers.
  The result 8.0467 kilometers is displayed in the result label.
